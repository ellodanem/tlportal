# TL Portal — project context log

Local, append-only log of **git commits** and **pushes** for Track Lucia / TL Portal.

- **Automation**: enable repo hooks once (see `README.md` → “Project context log”). Hooks append a short entry on each commit and each push.
- **Agents / contributors**: follow `.cursor/rules/project-context-log.mdc`. If hooks are not installed, append the same style of entry manually after committing or pushing.

**Do not delete or rewrite past entries.** New entries go at the **bottom**.

---

### 2026-04-09 — infrastructure (manual)

- Added `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `.githooks/post-commit` + `pre-push`, `.cursor/rules/project-context-log.mdc` (`alwaysApply`), and `npm run hooks:install` to point Git at `.githooks`.

### 2026-04-10 — feat(billing): wire Invoiless recurring ID to service assignments — `7971634`

- **Agent notes** — Option B billing integration hardening (Steps 2, 3, 5):
- `components/admin/device-service-assignment-edit-form.tsx` — added **Invoiless recurring ID** text field; saving writes `invoilessRecurringId` to the assignment row.
- `app/admin/devices/actions.ts` (`updateServiceAssignmentDates`) — parses and persists `invoilessRecurringId` (clear field to unlink).
- `app/admin/devices/[id]/edit/page.tsx` — passes `defaultInvoilessRecurringId` prop; uses `select` instead of `include` for the open assignment query so new field is available.
- `app/admin/customers/[id]/page.tsx` — service history table gains a **Billing** column: green "↻ Linked" badge (tooltip shows ID) when recurring is linked, dash otherwise; last payment status shown beneath when present.

### 2026-04-10 — feat(devices): sortable Status and Assigned To columns — `45fa4c5`

- **Agent notes** — `components/admin/devices-table-client.tsx`:
- Status and Assigned To column headers are now clickable sort buttons with a `↑`/`↓` indicator.
- Click once to sort ascending; click again to toggle descending.
- Status sort uses a logical sequence: assigned → in stock → suspended → returned → decommissioned → lost.
- Assigned To sort is alphabetical by display name; unassigned devices always sort to the bottom.
- All sorting is client-side (no server round-trip); works alongside the existing search and purpose-scope filters.

### 2026-04-12 11:34 UTC — commit `7ccec9a`

- fix(1nce): use api.1nce.com for OAuth token endpoint
- `lib/nce/token.ts`: `TOKEN_URL` → `https://api.1nce.com/management-api/oauth/token` (portal host returned 404 HTML on sync); token errors that return HTML show a short hint instead of dumping the page.


### 2026-04-12 11:42 UTC — commit `d6a2833`

- fix(build): harden Prisma migrate on Vercel (P1002)
- `scripts/run-build.mjs`: `migrate deploy` uses `DATABASE_URL` = `DIRECT_URL` when set; retries only on P1002 / advisory-lock messages (removed non-functional lock timeout env var).
- README: deploy notes updated for migrate behavior.

### 2026-04-12 11:47 UTC — commit `b704edc`

- fix(admin): registration approve/reject without redirect in server action
- `registration-review-state.ts`: initial state + `next` URL for client navigation after success; `actions.ts` returns `next` instead of `redirect()`; `RegistrationReviewForms` uses `router.push` when `next` is set.

### 2026-04-12 11:50 UTC — commit `fc9c4d8`

- fix(build): avoid recurring P1002 on Vercel migrate deploy
- `scripts/run-build.mjs`: on `VERCEL=1`, set `PRISMA_SCHEMA_DISABLE_ADVISORY_LOCK=1` for migrate unless `TLPORTAL_KEEP_MIGRATE_ADVISORY_LOCK=1` or user already set the Prisma var; optional `SKIP_PRISMA_MIGRATE_ON_BUILD=1`; treat `pgbouncer=true` like pooler in the DIRECT_URL warning.
- README: P1002 causes, mitigations, and env tradeoffs.

- `lib/admin/customer-table-rows.ts` + `/admin/customers`: `CustomersTable` with rollup, services, next due; sort soonest due first.

### 2026-04-13 17:37 UTC — commit `07fae0e`

- feat(admin): sales proposals with PDF export
- **Agent notes:** Prisma models `Proposal`, `ProposalLineItem`, `ProposalVisualBlock` + migration `20260413180000_proposals`. Admin UI under `/admin/proposals` (list, new draft with defaults, full editor). PDF export `GET /api/admin/proposals/[id]/pdf` (jsPDF + autotable; optional logo + visual images). Env: `PROPOSAL_ISSUER_NAME`, `PROPOSAL_ISSUER_ADDRESS`; asset URLs for PDF use `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` or `APP_ORIGIN` when resolving relative paths.

Default draft adds travel + AMC lines and longer terms. Existing DB proposals keep old text until edited.

### 2026-04-13 17:59 UTC — commit `b3e9a86`

- feat(proposals): visual blocks — timeline, half-width pairs, alt text
- **Agent notes:** Migration `20260414120000_proposal_visual_kind_layout`. `ProposalVisualBlock`: `kind`, `layout`, `imageAlt`, `timelineSteps` (JSON). PDF pairs consecutive `half_width` media blocks; `timeline` renders a 3+ step strip. Default proposal seeds six visuals (platform, alerts + FleetGuardian pair, trip, install, timeline) with placeholders and alts. Existing proposals: new columns default to media/full; re-save to add timeline/steps in DB.
