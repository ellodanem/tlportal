# TL Portal — project context log

Local, append-only log of **git commits** and **pushes** for Track Lucia / TL Portal.

- **Automation**: enable repo hooks once (see `README.md` → “Project context log”). Hooks append a short entry on each commit and each push.
- **Agents / contributors**: follow `.cursor/rules/project-context-log.mdc`. If hooks are not installed, append the same style of entry manually after committing or pushing.

**Do not delete or rewrite past entries.** New entries go at the **bottom**.

### 2026-04-09 — infrastructure (manual)

- Added `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `.githooks/post-commit` + `pre-push`, `.cursor/rules/project-context-log.mdc` (`alwaysApply`), and `npm run hooks:install` to point Git at `.githooks`.
